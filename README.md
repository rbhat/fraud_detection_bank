# Bank Fraud Detection Analysis

ML project for detecting fraudulent bank transactions using risk-based scoring and behavioral analysis.

## Overview

This project analyzes bank transaction data to identify potential fraud patterns. Uses a combination of statistical methods and simple ML techniques to flag suspicious transactions.

Originally started as a capstone project for Berkeley Haas, focused on building practical fraud detection capabilities.

## Dataset

**Source**: [Kaggle Bank Transaction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/bank-transaction-dataset-for-fraud-detection/code)
- **Size**: ~105 KB CSV format
- **Quality**: 10.0 usability score on Kaggle
- **Records**: 2,512 transactions with 16 features

### Features Include:
- **Transaction data**: amounts, types, duration, timestamps
- **Customer info**: age, occupation, account balance  
- **Technical details**: device IDs, IP addresses, locations
- **Behavioral data**: login attempts, transaction timing

## Analysis Pipeline

### 1. Data Quality Assessment
- Missing value detection and handling
- Duplicate removal 
- Data type validation and correction

### 2. Exploratory Analysis
- Statistical summaries of numerical features
- Categorical feature distributions
- Temporal pattern analysis
- Correlation and relationship analysis

### 3. Risk Scoring System
Multi-factor fraud risk assessment:
- High transaction amounts (top 5%)
- Multiple login attempts (>1)
- Unusual timing (late night/early morning)
- Rapid successive transactions (<30 min)
- High amount-to-balance ratios (>95th percentile)

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Simple temporal features (weekends, time gaps)
- Behavioral indicators (amount categories, age groups)
- Binary flags for risk factors
- Outlier detection using IQR and Z-score methods

### 5. Fraud Classification
- Binary target creation (`is_fraud`) based on risk scores
- ~1.3% fraud rate (realistic for real-world scenarios)
- Features ready for ML model training

### 6. Model Training & Evaluation
- Logistic regression baseline model with balanced class weights
- Train/test split with stratification to maintain fraud distribution
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler for numerical variables
- Model persistence with pickle for deployment readiness

## Key Findings

- **Fraud prevalence**: 1.27% of transactions flagged as high-risk
- **Temporal patterns**: Strong concentration in specific hours (52% at 4pm)
- **Network analysis**: 609 devices shared across accounts, 551 IPs from multiple locations
- **Amount patterns**: High-value transactions strongly correlated with risk scores (r=0.552)

## Model Implementation

### Baseline Model: Logistic Regression

**Features Used** (11 core features):
- `TransactionAmount`, `CustomerAge`, `LoginAttempts`, `AccountBalance`
- `TransactionType`, `Channel`, `CustomerOccupation`  
- `IsWeekend`, `IsHighAmount`, `MultipleLogins`, `amount_to_balance_ratio`

**Why Logistic Regression?**
- Simple and interpretable
- Fast training/prediction
- Handles mixed data types well
- Provides probability scores
- Good for imbalanced classes

### Model Evaluation Metrics

**Primary Evaluation Metric: Precision**

**Clear Identification**: Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)

**Clear Rationale**: In fraud detection, precision is the most critical metric because:
- **Cost of False Positives**: Flagging legitimate transactions as fraud causes customer dissatisfaction, blocks valid purchases, and requires manual review resources
- **Business Impact**: A false positive means freezing a customer's account unnecessarily, potentially losing their business
- **Operational Efficiency**: High precision reduces the workload on fraud investigation teams by ensuring most flagged transactions are actually fraudulent
- **Customer Trust**: Minimizing false alarms maintains customer confidence in the banking system

**Valid Interpretation**: Our model achieved 100% precision on the test set, meaning every transaction flagged as fraudulent was actually fraudulent. This is ideal for a fraud detection system where we prioritize avoiding false alarms over catching every single fraud case.

**Additional Metrics**:
- **Recall**: 58.33% - Successfully identified 7 out of 12 actual fraud cases
- **F1-Score**: 73.68% - Balanced measure showing good overall performance
- **ROC-AUC**: 79.17% - Strong ability to distinguish between fraud and legitimate transactions

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run analysis:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook fraud_detection.ipynb
   ```

3. **Use data quality tools:**
   ```python
   from data_quality_assessment import DataQualityAssessment
   dqa = DataQualityAssessment(df)
   clean_df = dqa.assess_and_clean()
   ```

## Project Goals

### Primary Goals (Completed):
- ✅ **Classification Model**: Built risk scoring system to identify fraudulent transactions
- ✅ **EDA & Preprocessing**: Comprehensive analysis with 20-cell notebook
- ✅ **Feature Engineering**: Created temporal, behavioral, and risk indicator features

### Future Extensions:
- **Regression Model**: Predict potential financial loss amounts
- **Time Series**: Forecast fraud frequency over time
- **Dashboard**: Interactive Streamlit app for real-time monitoring

## Next Steps for ML Development

1. **Data preprocessing:**
   - One-hot encode categorical features
   - Scale numerical features with StandardScaler
   - Handle class imbalance with `class_weight='balanced'`

2. **Model training:**
   - Train/validation/test split (70/15/15)
   - Cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning
   - Evaluate with precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC

3. **Advanced models:**
   - Random Forest for feature importance
   - XGBoost for better performance
   - Neural networks with embeddings for high-cardinality features
